"""Anti-pattern: os.getenv() returns None for missing variables

This example demonstrates the classic problem with os.getenv(): it returns
None for missing variables, which causes runtime errors later in your code.

README Reference: "The Problem" section

Expected behavior:
- Runs successfully even though PORT is missing
- Causes AttributeError when trying to use the value
- Error happens at runtime, not at startup

Run this example:
    # Make sure PORT is NOT set
    unset PORT
    python examples/problems/01_os_getenv_none.py
